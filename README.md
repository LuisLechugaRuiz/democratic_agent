# Aware ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to Aware, the trailblazing agent ecosystem that embraces simplicity and power.

## Open Source

At Aware, we're all about open source. We seamlessly integrate the latest models for easy access, no tech wizardry needed.

Sharing is at our core, which is why we're crafting an ecosystem that grows smarter over time. The tools the models use get better with each interaction, thanks to the collective genius of LLMs run by our users. Imagine an ever-expanding library that tackles increasingly complex tasks on autopilot!

## User First

Simplicity is king here. Our mantra? Less code, more power. We're all about crafting the tiniest wrappers that unleash the most functionality. It's about making a system thatâ€™s a breeze to use, powered by the smarts of the models.

And hey, we get itâ€”not everyone has a beast of a computer to run these models. That's why we're cooking up a decentralized system to spread the LLM love. This way, everyone can get a piece of the action without top-shelf hardware. Keep your eyes peeled for version 1.0!

## Autonomy is Key

We're taking utility to the next level and unlocking LLMsâ€™ potential beyond just chit-chat. Our System framework is where the magic happensâ€”the LLM whips up and wields tools to tick off your task list.

What's more, weâ€™re all about ditching the grunt work. Let the models handle the repetitive stuff, so you donâ€™t have to.

Our growing event folder is the bridge to reality, syncing with real-life happenings, from emails to messages. Itâ€™s about giving you a personal assistant who knows what's upâ€”organizing your parties, sifting through your inbox, and more!

### Implementation

Aware dances to a two-tier tune: User and System. The User level is your friendly neighborhood chatbot, tailored to you with every chat. But there's a twistâ€”he's got the inside line to the System level. Just nudge him towards tasks you want to ace, and he's on it, keeping you in the loop every step of the way.

The System level is where code meets LLMs to breed reasoningâ€”and real-world action. And the coolest part? The tools get shared across the board, so your modelâ€™s toolkit just keeps growing.

Hereâ€™s how it all comes together:
